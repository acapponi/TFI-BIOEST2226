# Two-sample T-test

## A retake on the final essay for my biostatistics class, using R

For my bio statistics class on UNM they gave us a random data set to each student. The goal was to create a _fictional study_ and apply the right hypothesis testing. 

My data set is composed by two variables, one quantitative and one categorical with two categories.

Originally, I made this analysis using [Infostat](https://www.infostat.com.ar/), as we were though how to use the software during the course. By replicating it on R I'm looking to combine what I learned on this class with my R knowledge.

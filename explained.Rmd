```

## Introduction

For my bio statistics class on UNM they gave us a random data set to each student.
The goal was to create a fictional study and apply the right hypothesis testing.

```{r libraries}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
```

```{r loading data}
data <- read.csv("data/datos21.txt", header = FALSE, sep = "\t", col.names = c('weight', 'group'))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
